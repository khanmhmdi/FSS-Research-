# Few-Shot Segmentation Research Repository

## Overview
This is a test phase!

## 📂 Repository Structure
```
📦 fss-research
 ┣ 📂 datasets/         # Dataset preprocessing and loaders
 ┣ 📂 models/           # Implementations of different architectures
 ┣ 📂 experiments/      # Experiment scripts for different FSS methods
 ┣ 📂 results/          # Logs, visualizations, and metrics
 ┣ 📂 utils/            # Helper functions and utilities
 ┣ 📜 requirements.txt  # Required packages and dependencies
 ┣ 📜 README.md         # This file
 ┗ 📜 CONTRIBUTING.md   # Contribution guidelines
```

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-REPO/FSS-Research.git
cd FSS-Research
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'env\Scripts\activate'
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure that the necessary datasets are linked in the `datasets/` directory before running experiments.

1. **Branching Strategy**
   - Each person has its own branch(everthing that you think is not proper for the main but should be saved.)
    
2. **Code Quality & Standards**
   - Follow PEP8 for Python coding style (If you use ai that's okay but please after completely writes your code convert it to PEP8 version).
     
3. **Experiment Logging & Reproducibility**
   - Log all experiments in `logs/` with configurations, hyperparameters, and results.
   - Use YAML/JSON configuration files to ensure experiment reproducibility.
   - Document dataset versions, preprocessing steps, and evaluation metrics.

4. **Collaboration & Communication**
   - Maintain an up-to-date `docs/` folder for reference materials and methodologies.

## 📄 References
- Maintain a list of related research papers and benchmarks.
- Cite all sources properly.

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Continue iterating on current approaches and refining models.
- Document findings in `docs/` as we move closer to publishing results.
- Maintain collaboration and knowledge sharing within the team.

By following these guidelines, we aim to produce high-quality research that is well-documented, reproducible, and impactful. Let's keep pushing the boundaries of Few-Shot Segmentation together! 🚀
